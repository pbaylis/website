I've been saving a lot of code snippets here. To keep things organized, I'm going to keep them in a single page instead.

An ideal solution would be to have an embedded, dynamically updating page that listed all of my gists by category or language. It's not obvious to me how I can do that easily right now, although there is a Gist API. 

For now, here is the [list of all of my gists](https://gist.github.com/pbaylis). And below is a hand-curated list by category:

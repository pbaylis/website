## In brief

I am making a dataset of **daily average online sentiment by county** available for use by interested researchers. You can download the dataset [here](https://github.com/pbaylis/county-sentiment-data/blob/main/data/county-sentiment.csv.gz).

Each observation represents the average sentiment of geo-located tweets for a county-day between 2014 and 2022. I've used datasets similar to this one in several different papers to see how people's online responses vary with, e.g.,  [weather](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272720300256) and [wildfire smoke](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-022-01396-6). I'm excited to see how else they might be used!

The following sections give a bit more detail on the data (see also the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/pbaylis/county-sentiment-data/)).

## Backstory

More than a decade ago, I was a third-year Ph.D. student looking for alternative ways to measure how people value differences in the climate they experience day-to-day. At the time, Twitter was a new social media platform that let people publicly post their thoughts about, well, anything. It had a large userbase and many of those users elected to include their location (usually the city or neighborhood they were in, not their specific address or geographical coordinates). It struck me that I could use these posts to measure sentiment across the U.S. at a very granular level.

Luckily for me, Twitter also had a public Streaming API that made it possible to download nearly all geo-located tweets in real time. I set up an old server in our shared grad student office and it hoovered up tweets for the next few years. That dataset led to the "Temperature and Temperament" [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047272720300256).

Today, Twitter (now X) is owned by Elon Musk and is generally regarded a garbage fire. But the data I collected may still be useful to some researchers. I've been happy to share it with students and other researchers on demand over the years, but I haven't yet made it publicly available.^[Unfortunately, according to the terms of the API I downloaded the tweets from, I cannot make the original tweets themselves available.]

## Dataset construction

I compute daily averages of county sentiment from 3.5 billion geo-located Twitter social media posts (tweets) that I collected using the (now-discontinued) Twitter Streaming API between 2014-05-22 and 2022-05-18. Each post's sentiment is computed using the compound score from the [VADER](https://github.com/vaderSentiment/vaderSentiment) sentiment analysis algorithm. 

After computing the timezone and local datetime of each post, I compile averages by county-date (i.e., only county-dates with at least one tweet are included). The final dataset includes the following variables, where (*) indicates the unique keys:

- `fips` (*): County FIPS identifier.
- `date` (*): Date computed from local time
- `sent`: Average sentiment `sent`
- `N`: Number of tweets included in the average

In total, the dataset includes 6,972,641 observations and represents 3,456,549,038 tweets.

##  Descriptive statistics

The figure below shows the number of tweets included in the data over time. There are a few gaps, typically due to my connection to the API failing for one reason or other. The downward trend in the number of tweets is (I think) due to a combination of declining Twitter activity during this time period and a smaller proportion of tweets being geo-located as a result of changes to the Twitter interface

`readr` is a the swiss-army knife of data ingestion: it's my tool of choice for reading in text data in R, not least because I'm spending more time using the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/) these days. The `readr` documentation is a little lacking in that it's actually kind of hard to track down the single-character shortcuts for various column types. Without further ado:

```{r, eval = F}
"-" = col_skip()
"?" = col_guess()
c = col_character()
D = col_date()
d = col_double()
i = col_integer()
l = col_logical()
n = col_number()
T = col_datetime()
t = col_time()
```

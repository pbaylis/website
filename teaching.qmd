- ECON 371: Economics of the environment $\cdot$ [Syllabus](ECON371-syllabus.pdf)
  - **Registration note:** Sadly, this course is often full and I am unable to make individual exceptions to add students. If this a required course for graduation please get in touch with the Economics Undergraduate Administrative Assistant ([contact](https://economics.ubc.ca/people/staff/)). Otherwise, some drops do occur early in the term so please keep an eye on registration.

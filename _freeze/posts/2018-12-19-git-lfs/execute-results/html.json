Since the entire history of files is saved, it prevents large files from blowing up the repo. I'm not sure why it isn't installed by default with git. Anyway, I always forget how to use it.\n\n# Installing `git lfs`\n\nEach computer accessing a repo with lfs enabled needs to have it installed, otherwise expected files may not appear and the user could (potentially) screw the repo up by deleting the wrong things. More instructions [here](https://help.github.com/articles/installing-git-large-file-storage/), but for OS X I just run:\n\n    brew install git-lfs\n    git lfs install\n    \nNote that this only needs to be run once per computer, not per repo.\n\n# Enabling git lfs on a repo and adding files to it\n\nFor each repo, I need to tell `git lfs` which files or kinds of files to track. Suppose I want to use lfs for any csv files:\n\n    git lfs track '*.csv' '*.fst' '*.Rds' '*.gz' \"*.zip\"\n    git add .gitattributes '*.csv' '*.fst' '*.Rds' '*.gz' \"*.zip\"\n    \nFirst line tells lfs which patterns to track, second adds `.gitattributes` and all of the relevant files (if necessary) to the commit.\n\n# Checking in on `git lfs`\n\n`git lfs ls-files`: Show a list of tracked files\n\n# Cleaning up an LFS repo\n\nI'm frequently finding myself at the limits of my GitHub LFS storage space. Here's how I use [BFG](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) to do that. The following code clones a bare repo, drops anything bigger than 10m in the history, and pushes the update to GitHub.\n\n\n```{bash, eval = FALSE}\ngit clone --mirror git://example.com/some-big-repo.git\njava -jar bfg.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 10M some-big-repo.git\ncd some-big-repo.git\ngit reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive\ngit push\n```\n\n\nTo run this, you need to know which repo is eating up your LFS storage. That's actually not  straightforward, since (as far as I can tell) there's no quick way to see the storage for all of your repos.\n\n# Sources\n\n- [Install LFS](https://help.github.com/articles/installing-git-large-file-storage/)\n- [LFS tutorial](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/wiki/Tutorial)\n\n",

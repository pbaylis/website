Most of the time I recreate that functionality with `survey::svycontrast`. But, I always forget the syntax. This code demonstrates a minimal working example. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(survey)\n\nN <- 100\ndf <- data.frame(x1 = rnorm(N), x2 = rnorm(N))\ndf$y <- 1 + 3 * df$x1 - 2 * df$x2 + rnorm(N, 0, 0.5)\n\nfit <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = df)\n```\n:::\n\n\nHaving fit the model, we can pass unnamed vector with the right number of coefficients to get our desired linear combination:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsvycontrast(fit, c(0, 1, 1))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n         contrast     SE\ncontrast  0.96295 0.0648\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOr a named vector with any number of coefficients (as long as the names match). Or a list of named vectors. One \"gotcha\" to keep in mind: I have found that the latter syntax fails for some versions of `survey` and may be OS-dependent. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsvycontrast(fit, list(c(\"x2\" = 1, \"x1\" = 1), c(\"x2\" = 4, \"x1\" = 2)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n     contrast     SE\n[1,]  0.96295 0.0648\n[2,] -2.14280 0.2044\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf you want an easy way to pass `svycontrast` a `data.frame` of where each row is a different linear combination (and each column a different variable), below is how you do that. This is usually if you want to produce similar behavior to, say, running `predict` on a fitted model but A) the predict call for that model doesn't return standard errors (as with `felm` or `fixest`) and/or B) you only want to linearly combine *some* of the variables (equivalent to setting all other coefficients = 0). In either case, this will work:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsvycontrast_df <- function(fit, newdata) {\n  # Call surveyconstrast with a data frame \n  df <- newdata\n  \n  # Transform data.frame into a list of its row vectors\n  df_list <- as.list(as.data.frame(t(newdata))) \n  df_list <- lapply(df_list, setNames, colnames(df)) # Set all character vector names inside list\n  \n  # Return a named list\n  setNames(as.list(as.data.frame(svycontrast(fit, df_list))), c(\"est\", \"se\"))\n}\n\nnewdata <- data.frame(x1 = seq(-3, 3, 1))\nnewdata$x2 <- newdata$x^2\nsvycontrast_df(fit, newdata)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n$est\n[1] -27.3010987 -14.1320265  -5.0316602   0.0000000   0.9629542  -2.1427976\n[7]  -9.3172555\n\n$se\n[1] 0.44739533 0.21238204 0.06793543 0.00000000 0.06480695 0.20441102 0.43468373\n```\n:::\n:::\n",

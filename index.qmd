I'm an associate professor and environmental economist at the [Vancouver School of Economics](http://economics.ubc.ca/) at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) (UBC). I study how  people respond to environmental threats like wildfires, air pollution, and extreme temperatures.

Some of my recent [work](/research/) includes evaluating the effectiveness of wildland building codes on home survival during wildfires, assessing the implicit subsidy of federal wildfire suppression, and measuring demand for air quality improvements in Delhi.

Many of my projects use large datasets, natural language processing, spatial information, or all three; as a result, I do most of my data work in [R](https://www.r-project.org)/[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) and [Python](https://www.python.org). When not in front of my computer, you might find me [running](/img/IMG_0613.jpg), [baking sourdough](/posts/2020-04-12-bread-notes/2020-04-12-bread-notes.html), or [throwing a frisbee](/img/frisbee-montage.jpg).

Before I joined UBC, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Stanford Center on Food Security and the Environment](http://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/), a graduate student in [Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC-Berkeley](http://areweb.berkeley.edu), and a research assistant at the [Energy Institute at Haas](https://ei.haas.berkeley.edu). I am also a proud alumnus of [Carleton College](https://www.carleton.edu/).

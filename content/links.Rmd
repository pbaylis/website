- [Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham's Beamer Tips](https://github.com/paulgp/beamer-tips)

## R

- [Library of Statistical Techniques (LOST)](https://lost-stats.github.io/)
- [Debugging R]([https://seananderson.ca/2013/08/23/debugging-r/]) (Sean Anderson): In short, use `browser()`.
- [RMarkdown templates](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/document-templates.html#): Good starting point for how to create RMarkdown templates.
- [R table-making principles](https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/design-principles.html): Compares huxtable to everything else.
- [Why we shouldn't use dual axes (except for linear transformations)](https://blog.datawrapper.de/dualaxis/) (Lisa Charlotte Rost)
- [Projection wizard](https://projectionwizard.org/)

### R Packages

- [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/) - Easy ML in R
- [arrow](https://jthomasmock.github.io/arrow-dplyr/#/all-together-now) - efficiently explore large datasets
- [vroom](https://vroom.r-lib.org/) - Faster file reading than even data.table.
- [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/) - Make for R
- [torch](https://blogs.rstudio.com/ai/posts/2020-09-29-introducing-torch-for-r/) - torch connectors for R. Will this be the year I learn to deep learn? Maybe.
- [modelsummary](https://github.com/vincentarelbundock/modelsummary/#installation): Publication-ready summary statistics, tidy-style.
- [gt](https://gt.rstudio.com/): RStudio's new package for table-making.
- [tmap](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap): Create decent maps quickly. Probably not a full replacement for publication-quality maps with ggplot2, though.
- [datadrivencv](http://nickstrayer.me/datadrivencv/): reduce the burden of maintaining a CV
- [{disk.frame}](https://diskframe.com/articles/intro-disk-frame.html): Manipulate larger-than-memory datasets (similar to Spark, Dask, JuliaDB)
- [pacman](http://trinker.github.io/pacman/vignettes/Introduction_to_pacman.html) - Package manager for R
- [fixest](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fixest/vignettes/fixest_walkthrough.html): Fastest fixed effect estimation, includes non-linear approaches. Also includes the very-good `etable` function for making tables.
- [gghighlight](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gghighlight/vignettes/gghighlight.html)
- [cowplot](https://github.com/wilkelab/cowplot) (Clause Wilke)
- [glue](https://github.com/tidyverse/glue): Easily combine strings.
- [patchwork](https://github.com/thomasp85/patchwork): Easily lay out ggplot figures.
- [qs](https://github.com/traversc/qs): Faster drop-resplacement for `saveRDS` and `readRDS`. Similar to FST, but can work on any type of object. Make sure to reload the relevant package (e.g., `sf`), though, or you'll get weird errors.

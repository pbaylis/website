<p>With the help of Keith Kirchner, one of our all-star graduate students, I’ve started to put together database of datasets for environmental economics, mostly to make resources available for students who take one of the two classes I teach where designing an empirical research topic is the goal, a goal for which having such a database can be useful.</p>
<p>This post (a work in progress) captures our initial efforts to pull together a list. The loose inclusion criteria are data that might be useful for applied environmental economics research. I expect this will be most useful to students in my courses as they brainstorm possible research topics, but I’m hopeful that it will be useful for others as well. Feel free to <a href="mailto:patrick.baylis@ubc.ca">send me a note</a> with other datasets that you think might be particularly useful.</p>

Datasets include census information, agriculture, energy use, pesticide use, household consumption, and much more. If you are looking for data in a developing country then IHSN is a good place to start.","Family Life Survey for Indonesians, Malaysians, and Guatemalans.","Longitudinal, multithematic survey representative of the Mexican population at the national, urban, rural, and regional level. Data has been collected in three rounds: 2002, 2005-2006, and 2009-2012.","This data set contains fertilizer use by crop in the main fertilizer-consuming countries. The data covers 27 countries and the EU-27, which accounts for 94% of global fertilizer consumption.","This computer program enables the calculation of crop water requirements and irrigation requirements based on soil, climate and crop data.","This data set contains estimates for green, blue and grey water footprints of crops, derived crop products, biofuels, livestock products, and industrial products. All data are available at national and sub-national level.","This database consists of information and estimates on price and income elasticities for agricultural products. Most of the demand elasticities in this data product are from academic and government research conducted in the United States on consumer demand, as published in working papers, dissertations, and peer-reviewed journals and as presented at professional conferences in the United States. The most fully covered countries are the United States and China, and the greatest number of demand studies are for vegetables, fruits, and grocery products such as coffee and ketchup.","This database provides population data and projections for each country from 1950–2100 and food production, food trade, and agriculture-related resource use data for 1961–2014. There is also a suite of food security indices. In order to provide complete spatial and temporal coverage, some data provided is interpolated or modeled. One should pay close attention to the documentation before proceeding with an analysis.","This database consists of productions and trade data in terms of price and quantity by country for 1950–2012.

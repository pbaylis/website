I'm an environmental economist and assistant professor at the [Vancouver School of Economics](http://economics.ubc.ca/). I study the economic impacts of and possible responses to climate change.

Specifically, my current [research](/research/) includes estimating the impact of temperature on tweets to understand preferences for climate change, assessing the implicit subsidy of federal wildfire suppression, projecting how climate change will alter peak electricity demand, and estimating how consumers respond to defaults in electricity consumption. I have a particular affinity for projects with large datasets and in which spatial information plays an important role, and my tools of choice include [R](https://www.r-project.org)/[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com), [Python](https://www.python.org), [github](https://github.com), and [markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/).

Before I joined UBC, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the [Stanford Center on Food Security and the Environment](http://fse.fsi.stanford.edu/), a Ph.D. student in [Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC-Berkeley](http://areweb.berkeley.edu), and a Research Assistant at the [Energy Institute at Haas](https://ei.haas.berkeley.edu).

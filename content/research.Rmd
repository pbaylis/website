## Other projects

- Along with an amazing group of faculty members and graduate students at the VSE, I helped develop the [VSE COVID Risk/Reward Assessment Tool](https://baylislab.shinyapps.io/risk-tool-v2/), designed to assist policymakers as they make decisions around when and how to open different sectors of the Canadian economy. The code is available [here](https://github.com/pbaylis/vse-risk-tool).
